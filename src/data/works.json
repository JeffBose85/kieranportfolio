                            "<p>The overall goal for this project was to make a game designer's life much easier when it comes to building up a game. The focus of the tools should be making sure that it’s easier and faster to do some things using these tools than without. So, these tools need to be powerful and efficient to be easy to use. They need to be made so that a designer can get their hands on them and use them effectively without having to learn lots of rules and methodologies to be able to use them. There also needs to be careful consideration when it comes to usability, especially when it comes to the user interface. Because if it’s difficult to use a designer won’t want to use the tool and just go back to doing things manually. If I can make free tools that work well and are easy to use, then this will be a great success for the project.</p>"],
